This server has an IP address, making it identifiable on the internet.</li> <li>Domain Name: Instead of remembering the server's IP address, users type in a friendly domain name (e.g., \"myawesomeblog.com\") to access your site. DNS (Domain Name System) translates this domain into the server's IP address.</li> <li>Data Exchange: When a user wants to post a comment on your blog, their computer sends data across the internet to your server. The server processes this data (e.g., saves the comment to a database) and sends back a confirmation.</li> <li>Content Delivery: When someone visits your blog, their browser requests the webpage from your server. The server sends the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) back across the internet to the user's browser, which then renders the page for them to read and interact with.</li> <li>Security: To protect user data, your web application uses HTTPS, a protocol that encrypts data sent between the user's browser and your server.

You can specify the role directly under this directive, and Ansible will execute the tasks defined in the role's <code>tasks/main.yml</code> file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can you explain variable precedence in Ansible roles?</p> <p>Variable precedence in Ansible determines which variable value will be used when duplicate variable names are defined in multiple places. In the context of roles, variables defined in playbooks have a higher precedence than those defined in roles. Within roles, variables in <code>vars/main.yml</code> have a higher precedence than those in <code>defaults/main.yml</code>, allowing default values to be overridden easily.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do you manage dependencies between roles in Ansible?</p> <p>You manage dependencies between roles in Ansible by defining them in the <code>meta/main.yml</code> file of your role.

Each module is designed to handle a specific task and can be invoked directly in playbooks or through other Ansible tools. Modules abstract away the complexities of interacting with different systems, services, and operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do you choose which module to use for a task?</p> <p>The choice of module depends on the specific task and the target system. Ansible documentation provides a comprehensive list of modules and their purposes, which can guide you in selecting the appropriate module. Factors to consider include the operating system of the target node, the type of resource you're managing (service, file, package, etc.), and the specific operation you want to perform.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can you modify or extend existing Ansible modules? How?</p> <p>Yes, Ansible modules can be modified or extended. You can write custom modules in any language that can return JSON (though Python is the most common choice due to its readability and the extensive library support). Custom modules must be placed in a directory recognized by Ansible, such as a <code>library/</code> directory next to your playbook.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain the idempotence of Ansible modules and its importance.</p> <p>Idempotence is a property that ensures a module can be run multiple times without changing the system's state after the first run (assuming no changes). It's crucial because it allows Ansible playbooks to be executed safely multiple times, making automation scripts more reliable and predictable. For example, an idempotent module to install a package will only attempt the installation if the package isn't already installed, preventing unnecessary changes to the system.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"7-iaas/ansible/7-vault/","title":"Vault","text":""},{"location":"7-iaas/ansible/7-vault/#what-is-vault","title":"What is Vault ?","text":"<p>Ansible Vault is a feature within Ansible that allows you to encrypt sensitive information, ensuring it can only be accessed by authorized individuals with the decryption key.
