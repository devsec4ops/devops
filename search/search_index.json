It's often described as a high-level, general-purpose language, meaning it's:</p> <p>High-level: You code using human-readable constructs instead of low-level machine instructions, making it more intuitive and natural to learn and use.</p> <p>General-purpose: It can be applied to various tasks and domains, from web development and data science to automation and system administration.</p> <p>Python's popularity has surged in recent years, thanks to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. It's widely used in fields like web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, and more.</p> <p>Here are some key characteristics of Python:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open-Source: Python is an open-source language, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute. This fosters collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Readable Syntax: Python prioritizes code readability with its simple and clear syntax. It heavily relies on indentation to define code blocks, improving its visual structure and making it easier to understand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interpreted Language: Unlike compiled languages like C++ or Java, Python code doesn't need to be translated into machine code before execution. Instead, an interpreter directly reads and executes your code line by line, allowing for faster development and testing cycles.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamically Typed: You don't explicitly declare the data type of variables in Python. The interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned, providing more flexibility but requiring less upfront effort.</p> </li> <li> <p>Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling you to organize your code effectively for complex projects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a rich standard library containing useful modules for various tasks, including file I/O, networking, regular expressions, web scraping, and more. This saves you time and effort by readily providing solutions for common programming needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Large and Active Community: Python boasts a vast and supportive community of developers, offering numerous resources, libraries, frameworks, and tutorials.

You should see a prompt like <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, indicating that the interpreter is ready to accept your commands.</p> <p>Here's an example of using the Python interpreter:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(\"Hello, Python!\")\nHello, Python!\n</code></pre> <p>You can also run Python scripts saved in files using the interpreter. For example, if you have a file called <code>hello.py</code> containing the line <code>print(\"Hello, Python!\")</code>, you can run it using <code>python hello.py</code>.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook for a more feature-rich coding experience.</p>"},{"location":"2-scripting/python/1-introduction/#basic-syntax-and-keywords","title":"Basic syntax and keywords","text":"<p>Python has a simple and consistent syntax that's easy to read and understand.

This makes the code visually clear and reduces the need for explicit block delimiters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Variables: You can declare variables and assign values to them using the <code>=</code> operator.
