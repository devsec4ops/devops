#Network Topolgies
The Star Topology is widely favored in real-time networks for its centralized management, fault isolation, and scalability. Its use of a central hub or switch simplifies network operations and ensures reliability across diverse environments.

1.  Bus Topology:
    -   Pros:
        -   Simple and inexpensive to implement.
        -   Requires less cabling than other topologies.
    -   Cons:
        -   Susceptible to cable failures, which can disrupt the entire network.
        -   Limited scalability and performance as the number of devices increases.
2.  Star Topology:
    -   Pros:
        -   Centralized management and easy troubleshooting.
        -   Fault isolation, as a failure in one device does not affect others.
    -   Cons:
        -   Dependent on the central hub/switch, which can become a single point of failure.
        -   Requires more cabling than bus topology.
3.  Ring Topology:
    -   Pros:
        -   Provides equal access to all devices and uniform data transmission.
        -   Offers fault tolerance, as data can travel in both directions around the ring.
    -   Cons:
        -   A failure in one device or cable segment can disrupt the entire network.
        -   Limited scalability and difficult troubleshooting due to the closed-loop configuration.
4.  Mesh Topology:
    -   Pros:
        -   High reliability and fault tolerance due to redundant paths.
        -   Offers excellent scalability and performance in large networks.
    -   Cons:
        -   Requires significant cabling and configuration effort, making it expensive to implement.
        -   Complex to manage and troubleshoot, especially as the network size increases.
5.  Hybrid Topology:
    -   Pros:
        -   Combines the advantages of multiple topologies to meet diverse network requirements.
        -   Offers flexibility and scalability to accommodate changing network needs.
    -   Cons:
        -   Can be complex to design, implement, and manage.
        -   Requires careful planning to ensure compatibility and interoperability between different topology components.
