## What is Networking ?

Networking involves connecting computers, servers, and other devices to share data and resources, enabling communication and collaboration across different locations. 
Networking is foundational to the internet, enterprise environments, and various forms of digital communication.

The data packets travel to a local ISP, then to the network where the website is hosted. 
Upon reaching the company's network, the packets pass through a link-layer switch and arrive at the designated server.
