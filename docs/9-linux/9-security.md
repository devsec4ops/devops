# **Security**

#### Understanding the Components

-   Kernel Security: The core of Linux security, involving mechanisms like namespaces, cgroups, and security modules (SELinux, AppArmor) to isolate and control resources.
-   User Authentication: Managing who can access the system, focusing on password policies, SSH keys, and advanced methods like two-factor authentication.
-   File System Security: Enforcing who can read, write, or execute files through permissions, ACLs (Access Control Lists), and encryption for data at rest.
-   Network Security: Controlling incoming and outgoing traffic with firewalls (`iptables`, `firewalld`), securing data in transit (SSL/TLS), and reducing exposure (disabling unused services, ports).
-   
### Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of a user or process, establishing *who* can log in or access the system.

Components & Methods:

1.  Login Credentials
    -   The standard method involving username and password verification.
    -   Managed through `/etc/passwd` for user information and `/etc/shadow` for encrypted passwords.
2.  PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
    -   A framework that integrates multiple authentication methods, from standard password authentication to more complex mechanisms like OTPs.
    -   Configurable via `/etc/pam.d/` directory.
3.  SSH Keys
    -   Used for secure, password-less remote access, relying on public-private key cryptography.
    -   Keys are stored in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for users.
4.  Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    -   Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a text message code or an app-generated code) along with the password.
5.  Kerberos
    -   A network authentication protocol that uses tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

### Authorization

Authorization determines the access level or permissions of an authenticated user or process, specifying *what* they can do within the system.

**Components & Methods:**

1.  **File Permissions**
    - Determines access rights to files and directories based on ownership (user, group) and others, using read, write, and execute permissions.
2.  **Sudoers Configuration**
    - Controls which users/groups can execute commands as other users via the `sudo` command, defined in `/etc/sudoers` or `/etc/sudoers.d/`.
3.  **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
    - Provides more fine-grained access control for files and directories beyond the standard user/group/others model, allowing specific permissions for any user or group.
4.  **SELinux and AppArmor**
    - Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems that enforce security policies, limiting what processes can access and do, regardless of traditional Unix permissions.
5.  **Capabilities**
    - A feature that divides the powers of the root user into distinct privileges, which can be independently assigned to or removed from processes, allowing for more granular control over system permissions.

#### Security Patterns and Best Practices

1\. The Principle of Least Privilege
-   Pattern: Ensure entities (users, programs, processes) have only the minimal permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
-   Implementation: Run services with non-root users, use `sudo` for administrative tasks, and apply strict filesystem permissions.

2\. Immutable Infrastructure
-   Pattern: Systems are replaced rather than changed. If a change is needed, a new version of the infrastructure is deployed and replaced atomically.
-   Implementation: Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) to deploy applications, ensuring a consistent and secure environment that can be quickly replaced if compromised.

3\. Defense in Depth
-   Pattern: Employ multiple layers of security so that if one layer fails, others still protect the system.
-   Implementation: Combine SELinux/AppArmor, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

4\. Regular Auditing and Monitoring
-   Pattern: Continuous evaluation of system security to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities.
-   Implementation: Use `auditd` for auditing, employ log management tools (ELK stack, Graylog) for monitoring, and conduct regular vulnerability scanning with tools like OpenVAS.

5\. Secure by Default
-   Pattern: Systems are secure out of the box, requiring changes to decrease security rather than enhance it.
-   Implementation: Minimize installed packages, disable root SSH login, and apply fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks.
