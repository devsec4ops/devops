# Non-Functional Requirements for Networking Infrastructure
Networking involves connecting computers, servers, and other devices to share data and resources, enabling communication and collaboration across different locations. 
Networking is foundational to the internet, enterprise environments, and various forms of digital communication.

The data packets travel to a local ISP, then to the network where the website is hosted. 
Upon reaching the company's network, the packets pass through a link-layer switch and arrive at the designated server.

This document outlines the key non-functional requirements (NFRs) crucial for designing and operating a robust, secure, and efficient networking infrastructure. These requirements are particularly relevant when dealing with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and other cloud or container orchestration technologies.

## Scalability

- **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling**: Support for adding more machines (horizontal) and adding more resources to existing machines (vertical).
- **Auto-scaling**: Capabilities for automatically adjusting resources based on demand, especially in cloud services like AWS.

## Performance

- **Low Latency**: Minimize delay in network communication, crucial for real-time applications.
- **High Throughput**: Ability to handle significant data transfer volumes efficiently.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Optimization of computing, storage, and network resources.

## Reliability

- **High Availability**: Designing the network to ensure services are consistently available with minimal downtime, utilizing redundancy and failover systems.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Maintaining operational continuity in the event of component failures, through service or data replication.

## Security

- **Data Encryption**: Ensuring data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.
- **Access Control**: Implementing strict measures for authentication and authorization to secure network resources.
- **Network Segmentation**: Utilizing techniques like VPCs and subnets for isolating network segments, reducing breach impacts.

## Maintainability

- **Automated Deployments and Rollbacks**: Facilitating quick updates and issue resolutions with minimal downtime.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring of network traffic, resource utilization, and application performance for effective troubleshooting.
- **Documentation**: Keeping detailed documentation on network architecture, configurations, and operational procedures.

## Compliance

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhering to laws and standards relevant to data protection (GDPR), healthcare information (HIPAA), payment data (PCI DSS), etc.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Ensuring data storage and processing comply with local laws and regulations.
