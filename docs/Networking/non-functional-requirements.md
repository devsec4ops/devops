This outlines the key non-functional requirements (NFRs) crucial for designing and operating a robust, secure, and efficient networking infrastructure. 
These requirements are particularly relevant when dealing with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and other cloud or container orchestration technologies.

## Scalability

- **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling**: Support for adding more machines (horizontal) and adding more resources to existing machines (vertical).
- **Auto-scaling**: Capabilities for automatically adjusting resources based on demand, especially in cloud services like AWS.

## Performance

- **Low Latency**: Minimize delay in network communication, crucial for real-time applications.
- **High Throughput**: Ability to handle significant data transfer volumes efficiently.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Optimization of computing, storage, and network resources.

## Reliability

- **High Availability**: Designing the network to ensure services are consistently available with minimal downtime, utilizing redundancy and failover systems.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Maintaining operational continuity in the event of component failures, through service or data replication.

## Security

- **Data Encryption**: Ensuring data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.
- **Access Control**: Implementing strict measures for authentication and authorization to secure network resources.
- **Network Segmentation**: Utilizing techniques like VPCs and subnets for isolating network segments, reducing breach impacts.

## Maintainability

- **Automated Deployments and Rollbacks**: Facilitating quick updates and issue resolutions with minimal downtime.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring of network traffic, resource utilization, and application performance for effective troubleshooting.
- **Documentation**: Keeping detailed documentation on network architecture, configurations, and operational procedures.

## Compliance

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhering to laws and standards relevant to data protection (GDPR), healthcare information (HIPAA), payment data (PCI DSS), etc.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Ensuring data storage and processing comply with local laws and regulations.
